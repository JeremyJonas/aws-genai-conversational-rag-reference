# Galileo Packages

Packages in this this folder are expected to be moved to separate repository later and become the galileo toolkit that is published for reuse. Currently this is a holding place in this reference architecture for reusable code that applications can compose to build a solution.

As this reference architecture matures and the community aligns on what is working and what is not, we will:
- move to a standalone repository
- support Jsii for cross-language support
- refactor, cleanup, improve, etc.
- published (npm,pypi,maven,etc)

Then refactor this reference architecture to depend on this new standalone toolkit rather than having it as part of this repository code.
