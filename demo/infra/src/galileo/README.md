# Demo Infra `Galileo` Folder

This is the holding place for reuse candidates that will get moved to `packages/galileo-cdk-lib` and eventually into AWS PDK.

Do not put application specific code in the folder, it should be generic constructs only.
Code in this folder does not need to be fully fleshed out to be ready for making consumable as generic construct, but
the intent of it should be in that direction at least.
